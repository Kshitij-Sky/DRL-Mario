This program uses magic functions which have been written to support the Spyder IDE environment. So it may have problems running in other IDEs. 


For training uncomment line 411 and comment line 414. Change training parameters on the same line.
Change movement method in line 142 as required.
After training is completed, some .pkl and .pt files will be generated.
Alternatively copy pretrained files from results folder and paste into main directory.
For testing comment line 411 and uncomment line 414.

While testing make sure you delete all plots periodically using the button in Spyder IDE (every 1s) so that it does not overload the RAM and lag.
